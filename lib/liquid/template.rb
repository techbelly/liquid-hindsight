module Liquid
  # Templates are central to liquid.
  # Interpreting templates is a two step process. First you compile the
  # source code you got. During compile time some extensive error checking is performed.
  # your code should expect to get some SyntaxErrors.
  #
  # After you have a compiled template you can then <tt>render</tt> it.
  # You can use a compiled template over and over again and keep it cached.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   template = Liquid::Template.parse(source)
  #   template.render('user_name' => 'bob')
  #
  class Template
    attr_accessor :root, :name
    attr_reader :resource_limits, :warnings

    attr_reader :profiler

    class << self
      def tags
        Environment.default.tags
      end
    end

    private
  end
end
